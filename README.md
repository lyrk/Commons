In 2016, Wikimedia Foundation removed the Commons app from all app stores.

This project aims to revive the Commons iOS app. It was made available on the AppStore for a while. Unfortunately, the current project leader's account expired and he has not renewed it because he is not doing iOS development at the moment.

The app requires investing a lot of time into it, but if you are very motivated please go for it! The [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.free.nrw.commons) might or might not be a source of inspiration.
